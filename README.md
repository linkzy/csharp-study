# C# Study

Welcome to the C# Study repository! This repository is dedicated to my C# learning journey. I've structured my learning process by breaking it down into various topics, each of which has its own code examples and corresponding blog posts. Below is a list of topics I will be covering:

## Basic Concepts
1. **Basics of C#:**
   - Variables. ([Blog Post](https://linkzy.dev/understanding-variables-and-data-types-in-c/))
   - Data types. ([Blog Post](https://linkzy.dev/exploring-c-data-types/))
   - Operators. ([Blog Post](https://linkzy.dev/blog-post-navigating-operators-in-c/))
   - Control structures (if statements, loops). ([Blog Post](https://linkzy.dev/control-structures-in-c/))
   - Functions and methods.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
   - Interfaces and abstract classes.

3. **Advanced C# Concepts:**
   - Delegates and events.
   - LINQ (Language Integrated Query).
   - Asynchronous programming (async/await).
   - Exception handling.

4. **.NET Framework/.NET Core:**
   - Understanding the framework architecture.
   - Working with collections.
   - File I/O and serialization.

5. **Web Development with C#:**
   - ASP.NET (MVC or Web API).
   - RESTful API development.
   - Integrating front-end frameworks with C# back end.

6. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Unit testing with tools like NUnit or xUnit.
   - Debugging techniques.

7. **Database Connectivity:**
   - Working with Entity Framework or other ORM frameworks.
   - SQL and database design.

8. **Data Structures and Algorithms in C#:**
   - Arrays, Lists, and Collections.
   - Stacks and Queues.
   - Linked Lists and Trees.
   - Hashing and Hash Tables.
   - Sorting and Searching algorithms.

9. **Structs in C#:**
   - Understanding value types.
   - Differences between classes and structs.
   - Use cases for structs.

10. **Advanced Topics:**
    - Dependency Injection.
    - Microservices architecture.
    - Design patterns.

11. **Additional Topics:**
    - Generics in C#.
    - Events and delegates.
    - Nullable types.

12. **Practical Projects:**
    - Apply your knowledge by building real-world projects.
    - Consider open-source contributions or personal projects.

Feel free to explore the code examples and accompanying blog posts for each topic to enhance your understanding of C#. Happy learning!
